Zeitwerk::NameError (wrong constant name 1camperSerializer inferred by Module from file

  /Users/darianag/Code Challenges /Phase 4 Ruby on Rails/phase-4-mock-challenge-camping-fun/app/serializers/1camper_serializer.rb

Possible ways to address this:

  * Tell Zeitwerk to ignore this particular file.
  * Tell Zeitwerk to ignore one of its parent directories.
  * Rename the file to comply with the naming conventions.
  * Modify the inflector to handle this case.
